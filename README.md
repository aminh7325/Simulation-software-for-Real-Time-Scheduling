# Simulation-software-for-Real-Time-Scheduling
I implemented software using python that can schedule given tasks correctly, and it can schedule tasks with these methods:
+ EDF(Earliest deadline first)
+ RM(Rate monotonic)
+ DM(Deadline monotonic)

It also shows you a graph with tasks scheduled and marks the tasks with missed deadlines

An Example of correct scheduling:
